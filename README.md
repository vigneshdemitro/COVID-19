# Covid-19 dashboard
This project contains a simple dashboard to check out the **Covid-19** pandemic disease data statewise in *India* allowing the
user to choose between two different dashboard styles.

This was my pet project when i was learning the art of web development, it's written using **HTML5**, **CSS3** and **vanilla.JS**.
